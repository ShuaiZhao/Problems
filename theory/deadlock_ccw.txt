For a deadlock to occur, you must have the following four conditions met:
1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can use a resource at a given time.
2. Hold and Wait: Processes already holding a resource can request new ones.
3. No Preemption: One process cannot forcibly remove another processâ€™ resource.
4. Circular Wait: Two or more processes form a circular chain where each process
is waiting on another resource in the chain.

deadlock prevention: remove one of the above conditions
