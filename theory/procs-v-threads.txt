process:
- an instance of a program in execution
- independent entity with dedicated system resources
- separate address space (can't access vars of another proc)
- use IPC (pipes, files, sockets) for that

thread:
- execution path of a proc
- changes to proc resource by one thread are visible by other threads
- same stack space of a proc
- multiple threads per proc
- multiple threads share parts of their state
- multiple threads can read/write same mem
- own registers
- own stack, but write-able by other threads
