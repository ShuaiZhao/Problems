macro:
- not compiled, but pre-processed
- expanded by pre-processor
- direct text-to-text substitution
- error-prone, should be avoided
- no context switching, no overhead
- no overloading
- no overriding
- no type checking
- cannot have a ptr to a macro
- difficult to debug

function:
- type checking
- can be inlined (to improve performance)
- can have a ptr to a f.
- can be overloaded
- can be overriden

inlined functions:
- avoids run-time overhead of a f. call
- replace each call with code inside function
- suggestion only
- 'longer' code (larger binary) if function called many times
- must be included in header file, change causes recompiling for clients
- extra optimizations (code available in context of use, not just f. call)
